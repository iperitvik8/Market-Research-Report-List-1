<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Catheter Ablation</li><li>Maze Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Device market consists of two primary types: catheter ablation and maze surgery. Catheter ablation involves inserting thin, flexible tubes to deliver energy to targeted heart areas, effectively disrupting errant electrical signals causing AFib. This minimally invasive procedure is preferred for its shorter recovery time. In contrast, maze surgery is a more invasive technique where a series of incisions create scar tissue in a maze-like pattern, preventing abnormal electrical pathways while often being performed during open-heart surgery.</p></p>
