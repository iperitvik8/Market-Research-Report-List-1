<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Elastomeric Membrane Roofing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sheet</li><li>Liquid Applied</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Elastomeric membrane roofing encompasses two main market types: sheet and liquid-applied systems. Sheet elastomeric membranes are pre-formed, flexible materials that are rolled out and adhered to the roof substrate, providing a seamless, durable waterproof barrier. In contrast, liquid-applied elastomeric membranes are applied directly via spraying or rolling, curing to form a continuous, elastic layer over the surface. Both types offer excellent weather resistance, UV protection, and energy efficiency, making them popular choices for commercial and residential roofing applications.</p></p>
