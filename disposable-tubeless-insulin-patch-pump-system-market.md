<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disposable Tubeless Insulin Patch Pump System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fully-disposable</li><li>Semi-disposable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The disposable tubeless insulin patch pump system market is divided into two main types: fully-disposable and semi-disposable. Fully-disposable systems are designed for single-use, where the entire device is discarded after the insulin reservoir is depleted. This offers convenience and reduces the risk of contamination. In contrast, semi-disposable systems allow for the reuse of specific components, such as the pump body, while replacing the insulin reservoir and adhesive patch. This approach balances sustainability and cost-effectiveness while maintaining usability.</p></p>
