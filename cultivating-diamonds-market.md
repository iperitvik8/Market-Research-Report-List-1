<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cultivating Diamonds Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HTHP Method</li><li>CVD Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The diamond market is primarily categorized into two cultivation methods: High-Pressure High-Temperature (HPHT) and Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD). HPHT mimics natural geological processes by applying extreme pressure and temperature to carbon sources, producing diamonds with similar characteristics to mined ones. Conversely, CVD involves vaporizing carbon-rich gases in a controlled environment, allowing diamond crystals to grow on a substrate. Both methods yield synthetic diamonds that are conflict-free and increasingly popular in various sectors, including jewelry and industrial applications.</p></p>
