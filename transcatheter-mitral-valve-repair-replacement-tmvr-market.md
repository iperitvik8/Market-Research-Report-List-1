<p><strong>The Transcatheter Mitral Valve Repair & Replacement (TMVR) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Repair</li><li>Replacement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Transcatheter Mitral Valve Repair and Replacement (TMVR) is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat mitral valve disorders. The market is divided into two main types: repair and replacement. TMVR repair involves techniques such as edge-to-edge repair, where the valve leaflets are sutured together to reduce regurgitation. In contrast, TMVR replacement entails the insertion of a new valve, typically through catheterization, to restore proper function. Both approaches aim to enhance patient outcomes and reduce recovery times.</p></p>
