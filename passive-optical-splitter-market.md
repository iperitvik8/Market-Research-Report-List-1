<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passive Optical Splitter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unevenly Divided</li><li>Divide Equally</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the Passive Optical Splitter market, two primary types are identified based on how optical signals are divided among multiple output fibers. The "Unevenly Divided" splitter allocates different power levels to each output, allowing for tailored performance in scenarios where specific branches require varying bandwidths. In contrast, the "Divide Equally" splitter distributes optical signals uniformly across all outputs, ensuring equal power levels, which is ideal for applications needing consistent performance across multiple connections. Both types enhance network flexibility and efficiency.</p></p>
