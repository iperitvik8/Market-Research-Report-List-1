<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The IL-6 Inhibitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>IL-6 Receptors Antagonistic Anitibody</li><li>Antibody against IL-6</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The IL-6 inhibitors market primarily consists of two types: IL-6 receptor antagonistic antibodies and antibodies targeting IL-6. IL-6 receptor antagonistic antibodies work by blocking the receptor sites for IL-6, thereby preventing its pro-inflammatory effects, which are central to various autoimmune diseases. On the other hand, antibodies against IL-6 directly neutralize the cytokine itself, inhibiting its activity. Both types are crucial in managing conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and other inflammatory conditions.</p></p>
