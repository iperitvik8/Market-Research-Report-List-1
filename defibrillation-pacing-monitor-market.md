<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Defibrillation Pacing Monitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Biphasic Waveform</li><li>Single-phase Waveform</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The defibrillation pacing monitor market comprises primarily two waveform types: biphasic and single-phase. Biphasic waveform devices deliver energy in two phases, enhancing efficacy and minimizing myocardial damage during defibrillation. They are favored for their improved patient outcomes and lower energy requirements. In contrast, single-phase waveform devices provide energy in a single direction, which may be less effective in certain clinical scenarios. Both types are essential in advanced cardiac care, catering to specific patient needs and treatment protocols.</p></p>
